*Syllabus, Fall 2019*


## Expectations

You are expected to implement and submit four fully working websites, to improve on those for your portfolio, and to confer with your mentor regularly. You are also expected to work on preparations for your final project.


## Deadlines

You must fully complete four projects, each before the deadlines listed below, to be eligible for a satisfactory grade, unless granted an exception in writing by the course's heads. Also, no immediate retakes are possible for any part of the course. You may re-take the course as a whole in a later semester.

|           | date                    |  
| --------- | ----------------------- |  
| Project 0 | Wednesday, 11 September |  
| Project 1 | Wednesday, 25 September |  
| Project 2 | Wednesday, 9 October    |  
| Project 3 | Wednesday, 23 October   |  


## Grading

To get credit for each project, demonstrate its functionality on or immediately after that websites's deadline. You will receive on-the-spot feedback from a teacher, and the website's completion will be noted.

Final grading for all projects will take place *afer* the courses' final deadline, to ensure that you have ample time to incorporate feedback from staff and peers. Each project will receive a grade using the following scheme:

| pts | description                                                                          |  
| --: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |  
|   5 | Exceptional quality in use, layout and code. Probably something extra or unexpected. |  
|   4 | Solid quality in use, layout and code. Maybe some trivial errors or oversight.       |  
|   3 | Reasonable quality, but lots of room for improvement.                                |  
|   2 | The app mostly works but really lacks in quality.                                    |  
|   1 | Clearly, quite a bit of effort went into it, but it does not really work.            |  
|   0 | Not submitted or very incomplete.                                                    |  


## Code reviews

In later weeks, you will be asked to plan code reviews with another student. This is an excellent opportunity to get feedback on your portfolio.


## Collaboration

All work that you do toward fulfillment of this course's expectations must be
your own work. You may read and comment upon classmates' code toward
fulfillment of projects' code reviews but only *after* the deadline for that project has passed and you have signed off your submission. You may integrate ideas and
techniques that you glean from your reviews of classmates' code and from
classmates' reviews of your code into your own work, so long as you attribute
those ideas and techniques back to your classmates, as with comments in your
own code. You may discuss projects, including designs, but you may not share
*code*. In other words, you may communicate with those classmates in English,
but you may not communicate in Swift, Java, or Objective-C and such languages.
If in doubt as to the appropriateness of some discussion, contact the course's
heads.


### Quoting sources 

You may turn to the web for instruction beyond the course's lectures and
sections, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not
for outright solutions to problems on homework or your project. However,
failure to cite (as with comments) the origin of any code or technique that you
do discover outside of the course's lectures and sections (even while
respecting these constraints) and then integrate into your own work may be
considered academic dishonesty.


### Regulations

All forms of academic dishonesty are dealt with harshly. In all cases we follow the directives
regarding fraud and plagiarism of the University of Amsterdam and of the Computer Science BSc
programme. Find them here in [English] and [Dutch].
